In general, we performed three sets of analysis on each dataset. For all models, we set options for contrasts to sum-to-zero and orthogonal polynomials.

## Geography based analysis
* This uses the geographic origin for each mitochondrial and nuclear genotype. 

## Matched vs. mismatched analysis 
* Next we fit a model testing whether matched (i.e., AA, BB, CC) differ from mismatched (e.g., AB, BC, CA, etc.) using the same random effects structure.

## Mitotype analysis
* Finally, we fit a model breaking down the mitochondrial genotype in to the 9 different haplotypes segregating in the populations. This led to the fixed effect model matrix being rank deficient (not every combination of mito-type Ã— nuclear genotype was possible) with corresponding R warning messages. We inspected model diagnostic plots and outputs when fitting these models to ensure reasonable model estimates despite the unbalanced design.

For all the analyses we plot reaction norms of the model estimated marginal means for each mitonuclear genotype combination. We also plot the raw data with `LINE` and mitonuclear genotype means with the raw data.
